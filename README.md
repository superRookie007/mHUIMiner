# mHUIMiner
This repository contains the source code of the algorithm mHUIMiner, which was developed for my honours dissertation project. mHUIMiner is a high utility itemset mining (HUIM) algorithm that scans transaction dataset in SPMF format and computes all itemsets whose utility values are higher than or equal to a user specified threshold.
