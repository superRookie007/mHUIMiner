# mHUIMiner
This repository contains the source code of the algorithm mHUIMiner, which was developed for my honours dissertation project. mHUIMiner is a high utility itemset mining (HUIM) algorithm that scans transaction dataset in SPMF format and computes all itemsets whose utility values are higher than or equal to a user specified threshold. 

The source code of the algorithm is contained in folder algoSimba(yes, I am a Lion King fan). The test folder contains some synthetic datasets used in the experiments for my dissertation. Standard and real life transaction datasets can be downloaded from SPMF website.
